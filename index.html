        <p>I am an organic chemist turned finance nerd turned business analyst turned web developer who has always had a passion for technology. I am originally from North Carolina, and moved to SLC, UT in 2015. I am a scientist at heart
            but have discovered that I am driven by the urge to create. This is what lead me to web development, and programming and computer science in general. I am loving the new world of learning, and hoping to soak up every bit of knowledge
            I can along the way. I am currently in the University of Utah coding bootcamp, and will be finishing in December 2019. I will then be looking to start a new career as a Full-Stack Developer, and am greatly looking forward to it! I am excited 
            to grow the portfolio you see here, and make some really cool things on the web. Please enjoy browsing my website. If you would like to know more, feel free to contact me through the Contact page. Cheers!
